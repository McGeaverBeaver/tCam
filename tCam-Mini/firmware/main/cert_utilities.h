/*
 * TLS Certificate Utilities
 *
 * Provides the self-signed certificate used by the on-camera HTTPS server.  The
 * key pair and certificate are generated on the camera itself the first time they
 * are needed - EC P-256, self-signed, valid for 30 years - and stored in NVS, so
 * every camera has a unique private key that never leaves the device.  This is
 * deliberately not a build-time certificate: a key embedded in a published
 * firmware image is public knowledge.
